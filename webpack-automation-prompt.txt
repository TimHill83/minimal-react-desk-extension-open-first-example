@workspace right now my app requires a fair bit of boilerplate. I create a react component for a widget, I then have to separately reference that in the webpack.config, to generate an entry point and bundle the js. Then I need a .ts or .tsx file in the root of the 'src' folder, which mounts the react component. I also need a corresponding .html file in the 'src/app' folder which provides basic html to mount the componentt into. Is there a way I can get webpack to automate some of or all of this boilerplate, such that if I create react components more each widget and the rest is done for me?
